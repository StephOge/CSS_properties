            My love for technology has always been a strong one. I am passionate about technology, 
            innovation and big challenging tasks on my to-do list. That makes me want to learn

                What I have learnt so far in stutern is as follows: <br/>
            How CSS is important: <br/> What is the importance of CSS in today's society?
            CSS is important because it controls all design-related aspects of your website.
            Typography, colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of your website 
            are all controlled by CSS.

            The difference between paddings, margins and borders:
            <br/> 
            Padding - The inner space between the content and the 
            border of your box. <br/> 
            Border - The perimeter of the box. 
            Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line <br/>
            Margin - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
